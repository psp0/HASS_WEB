### Features include:
* Connect to Oracle Database and Oracle Autonomous Database using hostname/port/service name, aliases in a TNSNAMES.ORA file, connection strings, and more. Choose a default connection to make it easier when opening multiple SQL files. Organize connections by folder, workspace or user scopes.
* Create and manage Oracle Autonomous Databases (ADBs) using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Explorer tree control. Create, start, stop and terminate ADB instances. Automatically create a walletless database connection or download credentials files.
* Oracle Database Explorer tree control: connect and explore Oracle schemas; show data for tables and views and save as CSV or JSON files; auto-generate CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE statements for tables; view, edit, debug and save PL/SQL packages, procedures and functions. Run stored procedures and functions with a UI for entering parameter values. Use filters to limit the schema objects shown and to limit IntelliSense suggestions. 
* Edit SQL and PL/SQL with support for hovering, Go to/Peek Definition, Go to/Peek Type Definition, Go to/Peek Implementation, and Go to/Peek/Find All References. The editor also features IntelliSense for autocompletion of schema object names, procedure/function parameters, and SQL*Plus commands. Navigate through large scripts using breadcrumbs. Format SQL and PL/SQL with a configurable formatter.
* Debug PL/SQL in stored procedures, functions, and packages using Visual Studio Code's native debugging features. Compile PL/SQL for debugging, step into PL/SQL, and run to a breakpoint. Enable External Application Debugging to listen for and debug PL/SQL procedures and functions called by applications or SQL scripts.
* Execute SQL and PL/SQL and view and save results. View errors in the Problems panel and navigate to the line with the error. Enter bind and substitution variables into a dialog.
* Use Select AI to generate SQL queries from natural language
* Explain Plan and Execution Plan
* Use Real-Time SQL Monitoring to identify run-time performance problems with resource intensive and long-running SQL statements.
* [Limited SQL*Plus support](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/dotnet/odtvscodesqlplus.html)
* View SQL command history and view and save SQL bookmarks
* Code generation using JavaScript, Python, Java and C# for data access applications 



### Feature Highlights


#### Create and manage Oracle Autonomous Databases 

Create and manage Oracle Autonomous Databases (ADBs) using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Explorer tree control. Create new Always Free or paid ADB instances, and start, stop, and terminate existing ADB instances. Automatically create a walletless database connection or download credentials files.

#### Oracle Database Explorer 

Explore your database schema in a tree control. Right click on the connection name to open an existing SQL file or create a new file that uses that connection. Show table data and generate CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, or DELETE SQL for tables. View, edit, debug and run stored procedures and functions. Explore other users' schemas. Use filters to show only those schema objects you are interested in.

#### PL/SQL debugger

Debug PL/SQL in stored procedures, functions, and packages using Visual Studio Code's native debugging features. Compile PL/SQL for debugging, step into PL/SQL, and run to a breakpoint. Enable External Application Debugging to listen for and debug PL/SQL procedures and functions called by applications or SQL scripts.

#### Use Select AI to generate SQL queries from natural language

Type ***Select AI*** followed by a natural language request and then execute the statement. The Oracle Database SELECT AI feature will translate the natural language into SQL and execute it. You can also choose to translate the natural language into SQL without execution. Additionally, you can ask for an explanation of the generated SQL.

#### Use IntelliSense to autocomplete schema objects 

Begin typing SQL into the editor and autocomplete suggestions will appear. Enter a schema name, schema object name, or alias followed by a period (".") to show the child objects. Enter a stored procedure or function name and autocomplete the parameter list. Modify the settings to choose whether to use upper or lower case. Configure filters to limit IntelliSense suggestions to only those you are interested in.

In the examples below, a stored procedure will autocomplete as you type -  or you can choose to fill in a template for the call:

#### Navigate SQL and PL/SQL code with Hover, Go to, and Peek 

Use powerful editor features to navigate and learn more about SQL and PL/SQL objects. The editor supports hovering, Go to/Peek Definition, Go to/Peek Type Definition, Go to/Peek Implementation, and Go to/Peek/Find All References.

#### Connection Dialog

Connect using hostname/port/service name, aliases in a TNSNAMES.ORA file, Easy Connect connection string, connect descriptor, directory server (LDAP) service name, or ODP.NET connection string. Organize connections by folder, workspace or user scopes. Choose a default connection to automatically connect when opening many SQL scripts. Choose a color to associate a particular connection with a results window. Other options include connecting with a proxy user, setting the current schema, and using a login SQL script.

#### Generate code using JavaScript, Python, Java and C# for data access applications

Select one or more tables or views in the Database Explorer tree control and generate JavaScript, Python, Java and C# code for accessing those objects. Code includes the actual connection string as well as instructions showing how to obtain the Oracle Database data access driver for the language being used.

#### Test stored procedures and functions

Use the Oracle Database Explorer "Run" menu item to run a procedure or function, enter input parameters and view output parameters. If the output parameter is a cursor, you can fetch and display the results.

#### Bookmarks and history

Save SQL and PL/SQL as "bookmarks" which can later be executed or added to SQL scripts. SQL history is stored for a Visual Studio Code session and can be run, added to scripts, and/or saved as a bookmark.

### Changes in version 23.4.1
* TAF failover type SELECT is mapped to SESSION. (Fix for error: "TAF mode of FAILOVER_TYPE=SELECT configured on the DB service is not supported.")
* 10g verifier available by default. (Fix for error:  "ORA-28040: Database does not accept client authentication protocol; login denied.")
